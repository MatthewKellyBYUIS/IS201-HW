    Although dinosaurs existed millions of years ago, their sheer scale and power still evoke fear in the modern
    imagination. These ancient creatures dominated the Earth with physical traits that would make survival for any other
    living thing nearly impossible. Many carnivorous species—like Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor—possessed
    razor-sharp teeth, heightened senses, and predatory instincts that positioned them at the very top of the
    prehistoric food chain. For early humans—had they overlapped—no weaponry or shelter would have provided reliable
    protection.</p>

    <div class = "right common">
 <p>Part of what makes dinosaurs especially frightening is not just their physical traits, but the uncertainty
        surrounding them. Because scientists rely on fossil evidence rather than direct observation, many of our
        assumptions are based <div class = "redtext">words for span span</div>on interpretation rather than certainty. Discoveries of new species every year remind us
        that creatures even more dangerous than the ones we know could have existed. When viewed through this lens,
        dinosaurs represent the unknown—an entire world of biodiversity and predator–prey dynamics that humans can
        barely comprehend. That uncertainty adds a psychological dimension to the fear.</p>

    <p id="pinkparagraph">The scale of destruction dinosaurs were capable of amplifies their terrifying aura. Some predators likely hunted
        in packs, meaning escape from a single dinosaur might still result in an ambush by others. Even herbivores were
        fearsome: the thrashing tail of a Diplodocus or the defensive spikes of a Stegosaurus could crush a predator—or
        a human—instantly. In a world ruled by dinosaurs, humans would not have been the dominant species, and the
        concept of safety would have been practically nonexistent.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, dinosaurs are frightening because they expose an uncomfortable truth: Earth has not always been a
        place where humans are guaranteed survival. These massive creatures remind us how fragile human existence truly
        is. Even though dinosaurs no longer roam the planet, their fossilized remains are constant evidence of a past
        where nature did not bend to humanity’s will—and could easily return to such a state again.</p>
